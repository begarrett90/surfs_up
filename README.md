# surfs_up

## Overview

- The mean temperature is only 3 degrees different (June :74.9 degrees | December:71 degrees)
- The minimum temperature varies by 8 degrees (June :64 degrees | December: 56 degrees)

## Summary (Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.)
The temperature is slightly cooler in December (71 degrees) as compared to June (74 degrees) but is still reasonable for outdoor recreational activities such as surfing to occur and warm enough for patrons to enjoy ice cream. The minimum temperature is colder in December (56 degrees) as compared to June(64 degrees) meaning that there will be days in December where there is not the same traffic however the frequency histogram shows that days with minimum temperature are infrequenct.

Additional queries that would be beneficial to this analysis include frequency and amount of precipitation as well as the number of monthly tourists. Precipitation will effect patrons visiting the business, if there is heavy rainfall people are less likely to go to the beach to surf and have ice cream. A query and analysis of tourist traffic will give an idea of high tourist seasons for the business to expect more traffic which can help with planning for inventory and staffing.
